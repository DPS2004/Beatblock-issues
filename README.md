# Beatblock issues
Public bug/suggestion tracker for Beatblock.

Important things to note:
- No code is stored in this repository, it is exclusively for public bug and suggestion submission and tracking.
- Bugs and suggestions submitted are not guaranteed to be resolved, though we will attempt to provide reasoning if we choose to not implement a suggestion.
- If submitting a bug that involves a crash, please include the crash report if one was generated.
- By submitting a suggestion, you are allowing us to implement it in the game. This may be done with or without credit to the submitter of the suggestion.
- When submitting multiple suggestions and bug reports, please separate them out into their own individual issues, instead of making one large post with all of them at once. Suggestions and bug reports that do not follow this guideline may be closed.
- Please search through both open and closed issues to ensure that your issue has not already been submitted. Duplicate issues will be closed.
- Reports that are marked as `more-info-required` for more than two weeks without any response may be closed.
